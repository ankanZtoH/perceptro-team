This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Managing Content

### Adding Team Members
1. **Images**: Place team member images in the `public/team/` directory.
   - Example: `public/team/member-name.jpg`
2. **Data**: Update `data/team.ts` to include the new member or update existing ones.
   - Add the `image` field referencing the file in public (e.g., `/team/member-name.jpg`).
   - Add social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Phone).
   - For Designers, you can also add a `portfolio` link.

### Example Data Entry
```typescript
{
  id: "1",
  name: "John Doe",
  role: "Lead",
  category: "Event Team Leads",
  image: "/team/john-doe.jpg", // Image at public/team/john-doe.jpg
  socials: {
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
    github: "https://github.com/johndoe",
    phone: "tel:+1234567890"
